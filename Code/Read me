Required libraries before run code

1. NMF
2. e1071

Used datasets:

1. Emotion : Variables = 72, Lables = 6, Examples = 593
2. Scene : Variables = 294, Lables = 6, Examples = 2407
3. Yeast : Variables = 103, Lables = 14, Examples = 2417

Folds used for cross validation : 5 
can be changed by changing variable name folds

Used machine learning algorithm: SVM (can be changed)

Used performance measure: micro average, hamming loss. (macro average can also be used)

If dataset changed then change var_size which is number of variables for each dataset, change as per mentioned above.
